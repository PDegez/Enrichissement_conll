<!-- Actant characterization (ac) must be linked to a sense.
It can be in the presup, as an alternative for an at,

<!-- Context (co): addition to the genus in a central component. E.g.
'X, wife of Y' : [cc X, woman [genus] married to Y [context]]'.
The term "context" is not suitable and will have to be changed. -->
